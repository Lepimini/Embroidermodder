# The Embroidermodder Project

https://embroidermodder.org

The Embroidermodder project is a collection of small software utilities for manipulating, converting and creating embroidery files in all major embroidery machine formats. The program [Embroidermodder 2](https://github.com/embroidermodder/Embroidermodder) itself is a larger graphical user interface (GUI) which is at the heart of the project. 

The [PDF manual](https://embroidermodder.org/docs/content/docs/embroidermodder_manual.pdf), this website ([embroidermodder.org](https://embroidermodder.org)), mobile embroidery format viewers and tools (iMobileViewer, MobileViewer), the core library of functions ([libembroidery](https://github.com/embroidermodder/libembroidery)) and CLI ([embroider](https://github.com/embroidermodder/libembroidery)) are all tools to make the standard user experience of working with an embroidery machine better without expensive software which is locked to specific manufacturers and formats. But ultimately we hope that the core Embroidermodder 2 is a practical, ever-present tool in larger workshops, small cottage industry workshops and personal hobbyistâ€™s bedrooms. 

Embroidermodder 2 is licensed under the zlib license and we aim to keep all of our tools open source and free of charge. If you would like to support the project check out our Open Collective group. If you would like to help, please join us on GitHub. This document is written as developer training as well helping new users (see the last sections) so this is the place to learn how to start changing the code.
